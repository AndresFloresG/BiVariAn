# BiVariAn: Bivariate Automatic Analysis

Simplify bivariate and regression analyses by automating result
generation, including summary tables, statistical tests, and
customizable graphs. It supports tests for continuous and dichotomous
data, as well as stepwise regression for linear, logistic, and Firth
penalized logistic models. While not a substitute for tailored analysis,
'BiVariAn' accelerates workflows and is expanding features like
multilingual interpretations of results.The methods for selecting
significant statistical tests, as well as the predictor selection in
prediction functions, can be referenced in the works of Marc Kery (2003)
