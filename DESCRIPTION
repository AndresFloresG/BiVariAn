Description: Simplify bivariate and regression analyses by automating
    result generation, including summary tables, statistical tests, and
    customizable graphs. It supports tests for continuous and dichotomous
    data, as well as stepwise regression for linear, logistic, and Firth
    penalized logistic models.  While not a substitute for tailored
    analysis, 'BiVariAn' accelerates workflows and is expanding features
    like multilingual interpretations of results.The methods for selecting
    significant statistical tests, as well as the predictor selection in
    prediction functions, can be referenced in the works of Marc Kery
    (2003) <doi:10.1890/0012-9623(2003)84[92:NORDIG]2.0.CO;2> and Rainer
    Puhr (2017) <doi:10.1002/sim.7273>.
