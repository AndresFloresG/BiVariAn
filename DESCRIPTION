Description: Simplify bivariate and regression analyses by automating
    result generation, including summary tables, statistical tests, and
    customizable graphs. It supports tests for continuous and dichotomous
    data, as well as stepwise regression for linear, logistic, and Firth
    penalized logistic models.  While not a substitute for tailored
    analysis, BiVariAn accelerates workflows and is expanding features
    like multilingual interpretations of results.
