## Resubmission
This is a forward. 
Due to the request received by email informing us of changes made to the ggplot2 
package, corrections were made to the code for the graph automation functions, 
as well as to the tests for these functions.
The code for the functions was corrected:

* auto_bar_cont()
* auto_bar_categ()
* auto_viol_cont()

As well as the code for the “test_that” tests for these functions.
